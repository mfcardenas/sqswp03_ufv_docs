# Impact / Effort Matrix

Sketch the quadrant (Impact on the Y axis, Effort on the X axis) or paste this table into your whiteboard tool. List remediation ideas inside each quadrant and cite the ISO clause that supports them.

| Quadrant | When to use it | Candidates | ISO Reference |
|----------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| Quick Wins (High impact, Low effort) | Ship first | | |
| Major Projects (High impact, High effort) | Plan for upcoming sprints | | |
| Fill-Ins (Low impact, Low effort) | Optional polish | | |
| Time Sinks (Low impact, High effort) | Defer or drop | | |

## How to fill it
1. Place each idea in the quadrant that matches its projected impact/effort.
2. Add a short clause reference (e.g., "ISO 9241-110 §5.3") to justify the decision.
3. Circle the two items you commit to ship this sprint.
