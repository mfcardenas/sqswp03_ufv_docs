# ISO 9241-210 Activity Checklist

| Activity | Evidence present? (Yes/No/Needs follow-up) | Artefacts observed | Gaps / Questions |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Understand and specify context of use | | | |
| Specify user requirements | | | |
| Produce design solutions | | | |
| Evaluate designs against requirements | | | |

Instructions:
1. Watch the prototype walkthrough and list any artefacts that prove each activity happened.
2. If evidence is missing, describe the gap so the team can address it.
3. Use this table to justify which ISO 9241-210 steps need reinforcement.
