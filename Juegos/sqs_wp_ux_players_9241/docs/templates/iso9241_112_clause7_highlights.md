# ISO 9241-112 Clause 7 – Emphasizing Important Information

Checklist:
1. **Order**: Present items in the sequence users need them. Slow reveal secondary details via progressive disclosure.
2. **Position**: Place critical signals where the eye naturally travels (top-left for LTR languages).
3. **Highlighting**: Combine typography, color, and whitespace—never rely on a single cue.
4. **Consistency**: Use the same treatment for similar priorities so users learn patterns quickly.

Reference these bullets when sketching storyboard frames that call out key metrics or warnings.
