# Guidance Element Decision Matrix

Compare proposed onboarding helpers by impact, risk, and ISO rationale.

| Element | User problem it solves | Impact (1-5) | Risk to ISO principle (1-5) | ISO clause reference | Notes / mitigation |
|---------|------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Coach marks |                        |              |                             |                      |                    |
| Inline video |                       |              |                             |                      |                    |
| Checklist |                           |              |                             |                      |                    |
| Upsell module |                      |              |                             |                      |                    |

Scoring guidance:
- Impact = how strongly the helper supports onboarding success.
- Risk = likelihood of harming controllability, error tolerance, or suitability for learning.
- Add mitigation ideas where risk > 3.
