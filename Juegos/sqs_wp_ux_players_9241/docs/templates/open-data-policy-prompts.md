# Open Data Policy Prompts

Use these questions when researching transparency requirements:
- What personal data appears in incident reports and how must it be masked?
- Are timestamps and GPS coordinates considered sensitive under local policy?
- How long must data remain publicly accessible?
- Which formats (CSV, JSON, PDF) are mandated for publication?
- Are there service-level agreements for updating resolved incidents?
