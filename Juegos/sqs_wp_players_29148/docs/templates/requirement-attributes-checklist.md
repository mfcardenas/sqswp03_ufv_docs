# Requirement Attributes Checklist (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 Annex D)

Use this quick test before accepting any statement into the baseline.

1. **Necessary** – Does a stakeholder, regulation, or constraint demand it?
2. **Implementation free** – Does it avoid prescribing design or UI details?
3. **Singular** – Does it cover only one capability or quality?
4. **Unambiguous** – Can two reviewers interpret it the same way?
5. **Complete** – Are triggers, actors, actions, and constraints stated?
6. **Feasible** – Can it be achieved within known technology, budget, and schedule?
7. **Verifiable** – Can you define objective acceptance evidence?
8. **Traceable** – Is there a clear identifier linking it to its source and downstream artifacts?

Mark each attribute ✅/⚠️/❌ and record follow-up tasks on the review log.
