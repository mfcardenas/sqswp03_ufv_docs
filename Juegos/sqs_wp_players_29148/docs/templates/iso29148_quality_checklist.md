# ISO 29148 Requirement Quality Cheat Sheet

Structure your sentences like this:

```
<Condition> the <Subject> shall <Action> <Constraint>.
Example: "When disruption severity is red, the system shall lock the crew roster until a commander approves changes."
```

Quality reminders:
- Write in **active voice**.
- Avoid conjunctions (and/or) – split into separate requirements.
- Include measurable terms (time, accuracy, throughput, tolerance).
- Reference the stakeholder or regulation ID for traceability.
- Use consistent identifiers (e.g., CITY-REQ-015).
