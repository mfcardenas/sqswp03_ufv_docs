# Traceability Matrix Template

Maintain bidirectional traceability from stakeholder intent through requirements and verification evidence.

| Stakeholder / Source | Requirement ID | Requirement statement (summary) | Related spec section | Verification method (analysis/test/inspection/demo) | Evidence owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stakeholder ID or regulation | CITY-LAB-B-01 | Crew reassignment lock when severity red | Clause 9.4 Performance | Analysis – queue proves < 3s response | Ops Engineering | Planned |
| | | | | | | |

## Usage notes
- Keep identifiers consistent (e.g., CITY-LAB-#, SUP-REQ-#) so change requests are easy to evaluate.
- Verification method should name the activity and metric ("Test – 500 concurrent events, 95% within 2s").
- Evidence owner is the role accountable for producing the artifact or witness log.
- Update the status column when verification is planned, in progress, or completed.
