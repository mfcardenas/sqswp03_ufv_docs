# Context-of-Use Worksheet (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 clause 6.4)

Use this canvas to capture the operational context before drafting requirements.

| Dimension | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Users / Stakeholders** | Who interacts with the system? Include persona, authority, availability. |
| **Goals & Tasks** | What outcomes do they chase? Describe frequency and triggers. |
| **Environment** | Physical location, environmental constraints (noise, security, mobility). |
| **Equipment & Interfaces** | Devices, networks, tools, or integrations referenced by the stakeholder. |
| **Constraints** | Regulatory, contractual, or safety boundaries discovered during elicitation. |
| **Opportunities/Risks** | Moments where requirements can improve/derail mission objectives. |

## Quick reminders

- Quote the exact source (stakeholder interview, regulation, observation).
- Keep measurements numeric when possible ("< 3 s response", "8 min dispatch").
- Highlight conflicts with ⚠️ so they can be negotiated before specification.
