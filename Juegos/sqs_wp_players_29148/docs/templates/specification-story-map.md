# Specification Story Map

Map ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 requirements into their specification sections and cite the originating stakeholder or constraint.

| Section (Clause 9.x) | Purpose / narrative hook | Requirement IDs | Source stakeholder / regulation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| e.g., 9.3 Functional requirements | Describe how the platform orchestrates disruption response | CITY-LAB-B-01, CITY-LAB-B-04 | Transit Commander, Annex F | Highlight measurable verbs |
| | | | | |

### How to use this map
1. List every required section from clause 9 (scope, referenced docs, interface, performance, verification, etc.).
2. Drop each validated requirement ID into the section it will reside in.
3. Capture the stakeholder/source to keep traceability visible during reviews.
4. Note any derived requirements or open questions that must be resolved before baselining.
