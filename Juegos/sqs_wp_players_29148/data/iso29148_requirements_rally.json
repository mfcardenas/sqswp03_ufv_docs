The new platform must consolidate telemetry, crew rosters, and disruption workflows without breaking existing contracts. This rally guides the cohort through ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 activities so every requirement remains justified, testable, and traceable.\n\nStudents will collect context-of-use evidence, structure stakeholder needs, write specification fragments, and close with validation assets that connect directly to ISO 29148 clauses.",
